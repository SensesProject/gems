  "description": "You can explore here scenarios how electricity and energy demand may globally. Results can be understood for three types of scenarios: one with a 1.5Â°C warming boundary, a NDC scenario (following the nationally determined contributions), and a 'no policy' scenario, which describes a pessimistic scenario of no climate mitigation at all. \n \n In a policy scenario electricity takes an important role in the end use sectors. Gases, solids and liquids declinm, also through less demand. \n \n The results are discussed in Schreyer et al. [Common but differentiated leadership: Strategies and challenges for carbon neutrality by 2050 across industrialized economies](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abb852). ",
