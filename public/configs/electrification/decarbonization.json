  "description": "The potential development of other important energy carriers on a global level. Results can be understood for three types of scenarios: one with a 1.5°C warming boundary, a NDC scenario (following the nationally determined contributions), and a 'no policy' scenario, which describes a pessimistic scenario of no climate mitigation at all. \n \n Electricity is not the only carrier of the future. The energy carriers below also undergo a transformation and a small share gets decarbonized. In the policy scenario (max 1.5°C mean temperature warming) classic liquids from oil decline very little on a global level, still liquids from biomass have some increase. Gas production from renewables is practically not seen in these scenarios. It remains bound to fossil gas, which undergoes a strong decline in a policy scenario. Further, in a policy scenario solids from coal are rapidly phased out and solids from biomass increase. \n \n The results are discussed in Schreyer et al. [Common but differentiated leadership: Strategies and challenges for carbon neutrality by 2050 across industrialized economies](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abb852). ",
