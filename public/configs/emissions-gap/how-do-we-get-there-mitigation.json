  "description": "The essential means of mitigation to achieve a well below 2째C warming target for different scenarios. This information can be explored for different policy strategies, warming levels, and with full or reduced availability of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies.  \n\n The Pep1p5 study is especially relevant, because it  aims to answer crucial questions about the feasibility of 1.5째C scenarios, related to the feasibility of policies - contrasting immediate pricing only (most efficient) and scenarios with gradual ratcheting up of ambition, also called bridging scenarios. Further it assesses the implications of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) availability. \n Important literature is the paper by Kriegler et al. [Short term policies to keep the door open for Paris climate goals](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aac4f1). \n \n Please note: Pep1p5 was conducted 2018. It is a single-model study, i.e. results were created with the REMIND-MAgPIE model only ",
