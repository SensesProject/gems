  "title": " Inner logic & mitigation of integrated assessment models",
  "description": "**You can explore here:**\n\n Individual mitigation outcomes for a subset of integrated assessment models that participated in the CD-LINKS study. \n \n These examples nicely illustrate how different the final composition of mitigation strategies by different models can look like. While one model focuses on large-scale deployment of solar energy, another model focuses on gas rather as bridging technology, or retrofitting coal infrastructure with CCS.  \n\n We learn that scenarios with their mitigation strategies should not be understood in terms of individual values, but as a whole. For example in a policy case of well below 2°C warming, high shares of fossil energy require CCS technology, while high shares of renewable energy require high investment. The underlying models follow various assumptions and have an individual inner logic. Please note, this model characteristics are object of permanent research and evolving. The information depicted below holds for the CD-Links study. <br/><br/>  The CD-LINKS study (conducted in 2018) is especially relevant, because it had a dedicated focus on required investments for mitigation. Important further literature are the UNEP Finance Initiative report [EXTENDING OUR HORIZONS]( https://www.unepfi.org/news/themes/climate-change/extending-our-horizons/) and the paper by McCollum et al. [“Energy investment needs for fulfilling the Paris Agreement and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals” (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-018-0179-z).",
